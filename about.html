            <p>Our mission was to encourage people to adopt rescue animals in shelters instead of just buying purebred animals online.
                We connect animal centers and aspiring owners in a seamless and user friendly app. 
            <p>
            <b> With just a simple tap, owners can meet their perfect companion. </b>
            </p>
                In addition, having an owner compatibility quiz and displaying all the characteristics and background of each animal are 
                steps we wanted to take so that

   <p>	"I adopted Bella using Purrfect Match two years ago, and it was the best decision I have ever made. She was abandoned 
       on the street when she was just a few months old, and is now living her best life surrounded by so much love in our
        home."        </p>

   <p>"My wife and I got Buddy after our kids left for college and he has truly managed to make our empty nest feel like home
        again. I go on runs with him every day, and my kids love to fight about who he likes more every time they come back 
        home. So grateful we found this app!"</p>

   <p>"I’ve always wanted a pet, but I really wasn’t sure which one would meet my needs as I’m out of the house a lot. 
       I’ve always been quite anxious about the adoption process, but thanks to the compatibility test on Purrfect Match, 
       I knew exactly what I was getting into when I matched with my sweet Poppy. She’s very independent for a young cat, 
       and I’m excited for our adventures together!"</p>

   <p>"Adopting through this pet app was such a wonderful experience! The app's extensive database of adoptable pets and
        user-friendly interface made it easy to find the perfect match for my family. We found our furry companion, Chip,
         and our home has been filled with joy ever since. Thank you to this app for helping us find our newest family 
         member!"</p>
